    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TPasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the
        fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put
        together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, diced</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup dry elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped Swiss chard</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="center">
            <li>Gather the Ingredients</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and
                crumbly,
                about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are
                translucent, 4
                to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to
                high
                and
                bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let
                simmer,
                stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.</li>
            <li>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom
                of
                the
                bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to
                3
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from
                heat
                and
                stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!
