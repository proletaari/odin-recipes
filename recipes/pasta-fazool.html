    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TPasta fazool is a classic Italian-American comfort food. This recipe works with any sausage, but I like the
        fennel and anise flavors of sweet Italian sausage with the beans. A hearty soup that's fast and easy to put
        together. This recipe makes enough for two large portions or four smaller ones.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil</ul>
    <ul>12 ounces sweet bulk Italian sausage</ul>
    <ul>1 stalk celery, diced</ul>
    <ul>½ yellow onion, chopped</ul>
    <ul>¾ cup dry elbow macaroni</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup tomato paste</ul>
    <ul>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed, divided</ul>
    <ul>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</ul>
    <ul>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</ul>
    <ul>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</ul>
    <ul>3 cups chopped Swiss chard</ul>
    <ul>1 (15 ounce) can cannellini (white kidney) beans, drained</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus additional for serving, or to taste</ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Gather the Ingredients</ol>
    <ol>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly,
        about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium. Add diced celery and chopped onion. Cook until onions are translucent, 4
        to 5 minutes. Add dry pasta; cook and stir for 2 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Stir in tomato paste until evenly distributed, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in 3 cups broth; increase heat to high and
        bring to a boil. Stir in red pepper flakes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to medium and let simmer,
        stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add more broth if needed.</ol>
    <ol>Place chopped chard in a bowl. Cover with cold water and rinse leaves; any grit will fall to the bottom of the
        bowl. Transfer chard to a colander to drain briefly; add to soup. Cook and stir until leaves wilt, 2 to 3
        minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Stir in white beans; continue cooking and stirring until pasta is tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
        stir in grated cheese. Serve topped with additional grated cheese.</ol>
    <ol>Enjoy!</ol>
